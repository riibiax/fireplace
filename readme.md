«Fireplace» is an interactive lumino-kinetic device, designed to influence human psychology.

The project is composed of a mobile app that records user’s physical activities during the day and of a domestic device that starts several visual programs based on collected and analyzed data.

Flicker effect, colour combinations, light frequencies, intensity, patterns and rhythms are used to influence user’s psychology and to get an hypnotic visual show.
